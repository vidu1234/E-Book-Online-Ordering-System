# E-Book-Online-Ordering-System

I made this online book ordering system in my university's application development subject. The coding portion of this project was developed using ASP.NET and C#. It was found that both C# and ASP.NET was very user-friendly and easy to use for developing web applications. So, this phase of development was completed very quickly and efficiently.
