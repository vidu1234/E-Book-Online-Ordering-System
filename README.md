# E-Book-Online-Ordering-System

I made this online book ordering system in my university's application development subject. The coding portion of this project was developed using ASP.NET and C#. It was found that both C# and ASP.NET was very user-friendly and easy to use for developing web applications. So, this phase of development was completed very quickly and efficiently.

## Screenshots of the UI

The system's login interface is shown above. This is the first screen the user sees when they start the program. After entering the correct user information, this interface will log the user in. The user will be redirected to the Administrator main screen or the User main screen, depending on the login details. If the user does not have an account, this interface also has a register function.



###Sign Up Page

The system's register interface is shown above. A new user can create an account by filling in relevant information and clicking the register button using this interface. It's important to note that all accounts created from this screen are standard user accounts. Due to security concerns, the administrator account is hardcoded into the system.
